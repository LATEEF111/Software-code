The file contains the developed codes of ML algorithms that were used to carry out LULC analysis in this study. The Classification and Regression Technique (CART), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) codes are to be implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) code is to be impemented in a python environment.
